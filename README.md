## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I started this blog as a way to document and share stuff I have learned and found useful as a software engineer.

Building and writing things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and ideas. I hope my blog could be a helpful resource for fellow devs who interested in web dev, eCommerce, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written 🍻

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- ⚛️ **React 18+**, **NextJS 14+** (App Router)
- 🎉 Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- 📊 Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/) website analytics
- 👀 Theming in dark mode with [Github dark dimmed](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-14-dark-and-dimmed-themes-are-now-generally-available/) colors for better contrast
- 👨‍💻 Making a lot of changes to the UI, new homepage design, adding `ProfileCard`, `CareerTimeline` components, adding `/snippets`, `/books` page, etc.
